##  Hi, I'm Amir Mohammad Khodadad

💻 Full-Stack Developer  
🌐 System-Oriented Engineer  

I build web applications with a strong focus on clean architecture, performance, and real-world system integration.

My approach to development goes beyond writing features — I care about how software behaves inside networks, how it communicates with infrastructure, and how it performs in production environments.
